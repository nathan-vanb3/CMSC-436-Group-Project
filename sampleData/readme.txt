Snippets from a note from Dr. Freeland to Kristina on 9/30 ~ 5:15 pm

Here we've cleaned up the data files (CSVs) into a simpler format representing how your careful
questions have guided us to where this project can most usefully go:

Three of these four these are each a simplified version of what I sent initially - 
and I think you can regard this new format as THE format for the sake of your project 
(basically we eliminated some of the columns in the initial, complex CSV by separating
 the data intoseparate files: the first few fields in the original file were basically 
 "flags" defining which set the data belonged to - now each set is its own file). 

The fourth file is a new - under creation over the past few weeks - which illustrates 
the idea that there will never be a "finished" set of CSV files...we hope for something 
where we can define new CSV's and then see where they map onto the other data. 

The final thing to mention, or re-mention, which might not be obvious here is ideally 
we don't want to assume what, or how many, numerical descriptor fields come after each 
chemical structure in the CSV - right now we are giving you a set of 3 identical measures 
in all CSV's but ideally this would something userws could change - it would be great 
if the visualization alerted users to what its finding and let them choose simply what 
to plot/see ("You have these CSV's available, these are the fields in each, what do you 
want to plot against what?")
